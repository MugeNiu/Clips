## Rumor Campaign

As police launched a national campaign against what they say is the spread of rumors 

online, discussion of how to curb the problem is, of course, taking place on Sina 

Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “Rumors need to be stopped, but how can you 

expect the average person to tell right from wrong?” one weibo user asked. “The 

officials don’t address sensitive issues timely or increase transparency, while the 

government lacks public trust. That is why people would rather believe in rumors.” 

Beijing police closed Er Ma China, a company they accused of spreading rumors 

online, and arrested two men. (The company serves as a sort of press agent for people 

who want to become Internet celebrities.) Many people applauded this, but some 

weibo users are concerned about the methods used in the campaign against rumors. 

They also worry is could be abused. Weibo user Wang Ying said Sina Weibo’s user 

reporting system could be a problem. “The general public might wrongly report 

rumors … and the police should not the ones to define what spreading rumors entails. 

This should be for the courts to decide.” Kaifu Lee, who has more than 50 million 

followers on Sina Weibo, has suggested three ways to tackle the spread of online 

rumors. “First, Sina needs to retrieve all the deleted posts and reposts. Second, track 

accounts accused and confirmed of spreading rumors in the past. Finally, analyze 

reposting trends and come up with a way to fairly assess data to find the large rumor 

spreaders.”

## Sex Scandal?

The arrest of Charles Xue Manzi, who has more than 12 million followers on Sina 

Weibo, shocked Net users. Beijing police arrested Xue on August 23 for allegedly 

patronizing a prostitute. Xue, a 60-year-old U.S. citizen, is a well-known venture 

capitalist and social commentator. More than 1 million weibo users discussed Xue’s 

arrest, making it the second most trending topic on weibo, just behind the trial of Bo 

Xilai. Many voiced disbelief upon hearing the news. State media reported on the story 

with prominent positions on papers or in prime time TV news broadcasts. Several 

scandals related to prostitution have angered the public in recent months. Many 

compared the Xue episode with a sex scandal involving four judges in Shanghai. One 

Web user wrote: “Xue is not an official. He didn’t patronize prostitutes with taxpayer 

money and his actions have less negative influence on the public. Why is this getting 

much more coverage?” Others suspect the arrest is part of a larger government effort 

to control online discussion, along with the campaign against online rumors. “They 

are after the big VIPs. See how Kaifu Lee now treads the thin ice?” wrote one web 

user, a reference to Lee’s advice on curtailing rumors.  

## Data Battle

Liu Ming, a lawyer in Changsha, in the central province of Hunan, is suing China 

Mobile over his cell phone data plan. Liu says his service contract does not say 

anything that would indicate data cannot be carried over to the next month. A post on 

weibo started a vibrant discussion on the topic, and a majority of comments sided 

with Liu. “He has the right to question,” one person said. “Why shouldn’t the unused 

data roll over to the next month? We paid for it after all.” But some say this is the way 

data plans work and why they are cheaper than pay-as-you-go plans. Many are 

surprised that a court took the case in the first place, and see it as another call for 

better regulation of mobile phone operators and a sign of improving consumer 

awareness. The Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission reports that nearly 45 

percent of consumers surveyed on the data plan issue say the current approach is 

acceptable, but the remainder wants their data to be carried over. The Big Three 

telecoms firms have started offering four-month plans in Shanghai that allow more 

flexible use of data. But telecom expert Xiang Ligang was skeptical. “I don’t see 

much in the new data plan,” he wrote on weibo. “Technological innovation is the real 

solution. Unless we switch to 4G, lowering prices is very difficult.”
